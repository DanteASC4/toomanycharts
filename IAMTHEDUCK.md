# What is this file?

This is kind of a mish-mash of my thoughts process and progress on things, mainly for myself because I work on this lib / tool primarily in odd bits of time I have which means it's a bit spontaneous, so it helps with remembering what I've been doing and why. It's also kind of a rubber-duck place as well for deciding on things.

Since this is more of a passion project I thought it'd be fun to have here where anyone could see.

The little **update#** are usually points in which I had stopped writing prior, but came back not to long after.

# 7/18/2025

Just realized I'm not really using min/max at all lol. I guess for now that's ok, I think incorporating those wouldn't be impossible but would be annoying to calc like a proportional automatic min or max based on given width/height.

Maybe not using it and just always having things be based on the height / width would be best to keep things as simple as possible for users.

Also just thought of labels being on the inside or outside. But that would mean viewbox padding if it were outside and not at the 'end' of each bar, since the start of each would be out of the viewBox. Though this wouldn't be too difficult to implement with a bit of exterior padding to the viewbox when labels are set to 'outside.' Unless that would throw off all the x/y caclulations...

## Same Day Later Thoughts...

### Min/Max?

Yeah thinking about it more, I'm going to remove min/max. I can't imagine a scenario where simple bars would be wanted with a scale much higher than the actual data, or less for that matter.

This also made me think of negative numbers. It would actually be not super hard to do that, automatically i.e. if there's any negative number in the dataset place all bars at center, with negative values below half or to the left, and positive to the right. But I think this might be better as it's own bar type like stacked. type = 'mirrored' maybe. Anyway that's for later regardless.

### Simple plugins

I think it'd also be nice to have a simple plugin system, like one for 'hover tooltip' that'd utilize modern APIs like popover and whatnot. Also a future thing but wanted to record that though!

Misc ideas:
- Auto-generate a small legend to go with a chart
- Hover tooltip utilizing anchor positioning

### BarChart Specific Placement

I think from the start I was a bit ðŸ¤” on the "orientation" key, and I just had the thought that for bar charts - it can just be the four sides. Left, top, right, bottom.

As for an intuitive key, I think "placement" sounds right. Which side would you like your bars sir? The top! Also means functions don't need to be renamed, can pass placement to vertical/horizontal and have that factored into the calculations.

# 7/19/2025

Ok so I've done some more thinking on both calculating bar placement & testing.


## Bar Placement

I think I can make the calculations more consistent, because regardless of which side the bars should be anchored to, the spacing should be the same. 

I will draw out a diagram and do some figuring out of the math related!

## Testing

So I like the way that testing is done now, but for development - it's a bit tedious. Each time I want to see the output I have to:
1. Rebuild the module
  - `deno run -A scripts/build_npm.ts 0.0.1`
2. `cd` into `e2e/test-svelte-ts` 
3. Run `pnpm install ../../npm`
4. Stop any current tests, and close any stranded chromium windows
5. Re-run `pnpm test:chromium`

This slows me down more than I'd like. I think later on this will be great for having a way to test many frameworks (vitest-browser is cool!) but for development I need something more rapid.

I'm thinking I might use `deno-dom` so I can create elements without needing browser APIs. But I don't want that to be bundled with the resulting library.

So I think I should be able to use a CLI flag when building to not use that, something like `deno run -A scripts/build_npm.ts 0.0.1 prod` or `--mode=prod` which is easy to pick up with Deno. 

### Update1

Actually I think that importing a library at all means it will be it the output, but whatever for now I'll roll with it. And I guess that means it'll work server side which is cool and something I hadn't considered. Maybe it'd be better like that??

### Update2

@b-fuze/deno-dom `doc.createElementNS('http://www.w3.org/2000/svg')` unimplemented...

## Docs

The docs will be made with fumadocs! Looks too clean.

## many hours later...

Ok so in figuring out the bar placement, I went down a rabbit hole for a few hours drawing things out on excalidraw. I'll include that in the `extras` folder.

***The read order for it is roughly top-down first, then left to right. Each train of though I'd mostly go down, and then shift to the right & start from the top when thinking through something more different.***

But I think this time I've really nailed the spacing down so I'm excited to implement the new methodology I found. I'm sure this is a solved problem out there but it was fun to arrive at my own answer.

as for the **testing** side of things. Welp, the `SVG` namespace is not yet implemented for deno-dom. Sooooooo either I install an npm package which I'd like to avoid or just continue testing the builds.

I could probably just make a nushell script for it or something, or `watch-exec` it.

# 7/20/2025

Ok so it's the next day, I've finished the first implementation of the new method! And I was considering my options with the whole `deno-dom` reporting that the namespace is unimplemented. But I had the thought of just trying it with `createElement` and that works!

I'm sure thre will be some caveats, but I'll do my best to keep in mind that any weird issues later on could be from this.

## Scales & More?

Did some more thinking about the scales of said charts, and I feel more firmly that not using `min/max` at least for the bar chart is definitely the way to go.

Ultimately, I don't want to try to compete with the many amazing data vis libraries/frameworks that exist and do all the detailed aspects super in-depth and more.

This whole thing was inspired partially by google sheet's sparkline function, I thought it was quite interesting how a simple rectangle could so vastly enhance data readability when used correctly.

So I want to keep the actual data side of creating charts dead simple.

Maybe if I add more charts, more things would be needed, but right now I want to keep the only things needed as an array of data. I had some more thoughts on the labels, which I'll get to later but I think I should do some more testing of the new bar chart creation method before I get ahead of myself.

## Update1

After a small tweak to some math, it's working! For all four sides! I even tested it with rectangular dimensions and it works! Which makes sense but is still nice to see.

Ok time to push.

## Update2

Alright so I think the next thing to do is to remove min/max for the afore mentioned reasons, and then tackle labels, then color.

**Mini update**
Ok that was easy, since I wasn't using them lol.

### Labels

Labels. So like I mentioned prior, I had some thoughts about labels, I think it's a bit tricky all things considered, mainly due to font-size, which also depends on the font-family, and depending on the size of the container, some labels may get cut off in some scenarios & whatnot.

And that led me to an idea... What if I just control them with CSS? Lemme try it before explaining.

**Mini update**
Mission failure! But honestly that's fine. I'm also kind of glad, because I had the scary thought - what if everything could've been spaced by simply using flexbox ðŸ’€

But you can control some things via CSS, that I knew already. Like fill & some other visual properties.

I think the best thing to do here, is to do labels how I originally was going to, and then later on it can be improved, and I'll I'll also aim to make a 'legend' plugin as I think this would be another viable option.

I'll just rotatate it a bit as needed for each placement option.

**Mini update**
Luckily that part was pretty simple now, just used the bar coords with offsets as needed. But when the bars are on the right, placing the text becomes complicated - since everything is placed via top-left coordinates the same logic leads to overlap since text is added naturally from the left to the right, and in this case the bars are to the right. If there was a way to like "right-align" text so that when text is added, it's auto-shifted to the right that would be most ideal, or it could be placed via top-right coordinate instead of top-left. I think those both might be possile, but again, I don't feel like going down a text positioning rabbit hole right now.

I had also considered allowing the labels to have a placement mode of "outside" but nah, that's another rabbit hole of now needig to expand the viewbox according to font size & text length and whatnot. I think aligning some labels manually with CSS would be simpler and more reliable. I'll include many examples of doing additional stuff like this (CSS external labels) later. Because again I don't want to get crazy with capabilities - this is meant to be simple & plug-n-play friendly.

One thing I will do though, before pushing this is allow no labels. I think it's time to allow labels to be empty. I'll just have it default to an empty array. As external labels, a legend, or otherwise could be used in place of labels to potientially better effect.

Additionally though later on, I'd like to support image labels. I think a small image could be a great way of using labels.

**Mini update**
Done!

## Update3 - Colors

One thing that hit me just now is responsiveness. I think the simplest way to do that would be making coordinates for things percentages. But I'll worry about that later.

### Colors!

Ah colors, I love how something that seems so simple can be so crazy deep. At least it surprised me how deep the world of color is when I first explored it.

Any oklch enjoyers?

Alright so here's what I'm thinking. Currently for bar charts, the data will have one of two structures.

This: `[1,2,3]`
Or: `[[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]`

*(stacked charts currently unimplemented, but later I'll do it - just slicing up a rect)*

So I think the simplest thing for colors would be to allow the same data types.

#### E.g.

Data is: `[1,2,3]`
Colors: `['red','green','blue']`

then it's as simple as:
- bar 1 = red
- bar 2 = green
- bar 3 = blue

Additionally I can have it pick with modulo so we just wrap around allowing for something like:

Data is: `[1,2,3,4,5,6]`
Colors: `['red','green','blue']`

then it's as simple as:
- bar 1 = red
- bar 2 = green
- bar 3 = blue
- bar 4 = red
- bar 5 = green
- bar 6 = blue

And so on. This would also work for stacked arrays I'd just be moduloing twice depending on which sub-rect I'm coloring. Also this allows for any color type.

**Mini Update**
Got distracted and did a couple chore type things.

- I've added a "philosophy" section to the readme, where later I'll elaborate on some decisions (like no min/max). But I'll get to that later.
- Updated the readme to have a better checklist of pre-0.1.0 things

Damn it I just remembered I left `barWidth` in the parameters. Prety sure that'd throw off the spacing.
Tested it and yep. Of course. Ok well luckily - I can just use the proper width for calculating coords, and then offset the result by the bar width (if it's different).

Surely it will be simple to implement.

**Mini Update**
Phew, it was as I thought - pretty straightforward. Took like 5 minutes. Ok re-focus time, back to colors!

Except unfortunately I've run out of time for now. I've gotta do some other stuff but I'll come back to this soon!

# 7/22/2025

Two days later & I've done it! In my spare time I've got colors working, and not just normal solid colors - those are working just like I wanted & described above but I've added an additional coloring option! Gradients!

Now gradients is yet another thing that you can really go far with, but for now at least I've kept things relatively basic.

Here's a rough overview of coloring options:

- **No supplied colors**
    - Bars will be colored white when no form of coloring is chosen
- **`colors` array**
    - Colors will be chosen by using module on the index for each bar
        - This means you don't need to supply a color for every bar
        - Or you can add a single color to the array to have all the bars be that color
    - Can be any valid color format
- **`gradientColors` array**
    - When supplied will automatically create an evenly-spread linearGradient consisting of the given colors
        - E.g. `gradientColors: ['#ff00ff', '#00ffff']` will create a gradient like so:
        - ```
          #ff00ff #00ffff
        <-0----------1->
        ```
    - This also takes precedence over the `colors` array when supplied (as-in if both are given, `gradientColors` will be used)
    - Additional optional related params: `gradientDirection` and `gradientMode`, see docs for details!
- Note that **text labels** are not affected by any coloring as of now.
    - Mainly because I'm still a bit uncertain of whether labels will be fully supported given the difficulties involved, and perceived value added by overcoming them. At least for now.
- **stroke** has been largely untouched, but the same process would work for that and I think it would be nice to have as well. That's coming soon!
    - Unsure of whether gradients are possible in the same way. My gut says yes but I haven't tested it. Potential avenues for implementation:
        - I think masking has "border-box" or something related as a property, maybe
        - Could add a second `rect` behind each bar with a width calculated based on desired stroke width & bar width to give the perception of having an outline. This would also allow for coloring in the same way as bars at the cost of increasing the end payload size by a significant amount.
            Perhaps size could be mitigated via `<use>` (I tried this for the gradient stuff but I couldn't get it to work which kind of makes sense I guess, I may revisit it later though!)

This also meant doing a bit of a refactor in terms of output, particularly to support a really cool (I think) way of using gradient colors. That being the `gradientMode` of `'continuous'` which the docs will expand on.

Previously the structure was something like:

```html
<svg>
    <g>
        <rect />
        <text />
    </g>
    <!-- etc... -->
</svg>
```

And now it's:
```html
<svg>
    <!-- defs exists only if using gradients -->
    <defs></defs>
    <g>
        <rect />
        <!-- etc... -->
    </g>
    <g>
        <text />
        <!-- etc... -->
    </g>
</svg>
```

Which I think I actually like more anyway.

## 0.1.0 release

That being said I also did some more thinking and I've decided that for a `0.1.0` release `stacked` bar charts aren't really needed. I don't want to get sucked into the classic "I should do this before putting this out there" and then when I'm done with that I think "wait but this too" and whatnot.

This started as bar charts only anyway so it'll go out with just that!

That also means I've moved the todo-list to it's own markdown file.

# 7/23/2025

So I did some more thinking and had some more thoughts. Crazy, I know.

## I forgor

Ah I'm a fool. I was thinking about using the package myself now that it's mostly usable and then realized a major oversight. The way things are currently setup, with no max for the scale I had not considered making a barchart that exceeds the dimensions of it's container.

Put simply, I've been testing things with values that are less than the resulting size, if I were to use something larger - the bar would be extending past the bounds of it's viewable area. This isn't a terrible thing, "breaking the scale" in a way is also conveying information - but I know it's important to be able to change that behavior.

And tackling this means bringing back some form of `max`, I think what I'll do is:

- Re-introduce just `max` and use this to set the viewbox dimensions
    - Can be optional again, and when not supplied we'll assume something like 15% more than the highest datapoint value
    - Would need to set height or width according to placement option
    - Will keep the no "min" needed

I was also thinking about making things percentages, but that'd still use a `max` of some sort so yeah one way or another, `max` is back.

**Update1**
Alright I'm back & luckily it was a simple fix, just use the max as the viewbox's height or width depending on where the bars are placed.

This also makes me think that I should separate width & height from the element & the viewbox, maybe just as an override. But I want to field test things more before I do that.

## Docs

Aside from that the docs site is going well! It's a bit overkill feature-wise but fumadocs makes for a very slick experience just like I wanted. It's also fine because I don't need to use every single feature offered. 

Probably a few more days to finish up the first version of that as I want to include loads of examples.

## ssr, react, & more 

Initially I had planned for this lib to be client-sided, but the usage of `@b-fuze/deno-dom` allows for this lib to server-side as well.

There's a couple issues with it though.

### no `createElementNS`

Right now I'm just using `createElement` because `createElementNS` doesn't exist. While this hasn't resulted in any major pitfalls I'm imagining at some point I'll run into some sort of issue due to that.

The lib `deno-dom` is still alive though, with the most recent release being 2 weeks ago at time of writing. Perhaps I'll contribute as well?

I have noticed one issue though, that being that for whatever reason, when doing `setAttribute("viewBox","0 0 300 300")` the resulting HTML has `viewbox` instead of `viewBox`, it ignores the uppercase `B`. Luckily modern browsers don't care too much about that, and render it anyway but it does cause some warnings.

So that leaves a couple options.

a. abandon `ssr` for now, focus on client side only like originally intended.
b. roll with it, there's still no actual issues with things now, and switch libs later or hope for `deno-dom` to get Updated
 - (or help move the update along myself)
c. find a different way of creating elements for `ssr`

I'm leaning towards either `c` or `b`. Deno is awesome, and iirc one of the things it enables is a way of using languages outside of js/ts in projects.


#### `c`

So if I could find a library compatible, in any language I could potentially use it. What I'm worried about that though is **bundle-size.** Since I really want to keep this lib lightweight. I'll have to research that more, but it sounds both intersting, and potentially very viable as languages apart from js/ts could be significantly faster.

#### `b`

Option `b` is probably the more realistic option though, and for the time being I'm going to stick with what I have. Again, there aren't any huge issues as of now, and it works pretty seamlessly.

### environment detection

One thing I encountered when I was using the lib myself for the docs site was the fact than in react, the `class` attribute is `className`. That's pretty annoying. I've now got to figure out how to account for that. In the short-term a param for it would work just fine, but I want to be able to auto-detect this.

With `vite` you can do `import.meta.env` and read the dir contents, perhaps something like this would work & I can look for `.jsx or .tsx` file extensions.

Though if the function is used inline, I wonder if it would even be an issue, I was only seeing that get flagged as an error because I was pasting the SVG in directly instead of calling the function inline, since it was for including an example of the output.

For now I'll add a param that allows you to have the output react-friendly and later maybe auto-detect env if it's an issue.
- `className` instead of `class`
- `xmlnsXlink` instead of `xmlns:xlink`

I wonder if it should also detect if it's client side automatically to use `document.createElementNS` instead of `deno-dom`. That's a good idea I think.

**Update1**
I just looked through the `deno-dom` repo a bit and found a doc describing some of the goals for the lib. There's a section called SVG and right now it's described as "???" ðŸ¤£ funny though since it still is working alright for SVG elements!


**Update2**
Wait I just realized, the usual convention for this (I think) is to have framework-specific imports I think. Something like:
```ts
import { barchart } from 'nanocharts/svelte';
// or
import { barchart } from 'nanocharts/react';
```

I think this is better than what I was thinking with auto-detection of stuff, though it is an interesting idea. But I'll get to that later anyway, there's still much to be done for the core itself.


# 7/24/2025

The lib internals itself are a bit unorganized, as I've been doing a bunch of 'figuring out as I go' but that doesn't mean I can't stay organized. I also want to always keep that core philosophy in mind of being simple to get value from, but with the ability to take things further if you wanted something a bit more.

## Naming

I did a bit of thinking on this, and while I like the idea of having everything under one function, similar to `SPARKLINE` I think keeping exports divided based on the chart type would benefit the end bundle size, if my understanding of how that works is correct that is.

```bash
 â””â”€ tests # unit tests
 â””â”€ e2e # framework specific & other usage tests
 â””â”€ src
    â”œâ”€ utils
    â”‚  â””â”€ maths.ts
    â”œâ”€ creating # element creation relating to chart of filename
    â”‚  â””â”€ barchart.ts
    â””â”€ main.ts
    â””â”€ barchart.ts
    â””â”€ etc... # more charttypes.ts
```

# 7/25/2025

For now going to just commit to `deno-dom` to make it less janky internally, and I think I've settled on wanting this to work in non-browser contexts as well.

Still need to do a bit more before 0.1.0, that being:

- Cleanup
    - Match the above organizational goal
    - Do less "checks" for the user, with proper docs & error messages I shouldn't need to check things for the user really. This isn't referring to the default creation. I know that you can have default params but some of them are based on the presence or absence of other params so I'll leave that stuff for now.
- Docs site
    - So far so good, fumadocs is awesome.
    - Main docs remaining:
        - Barchart page
        - Loads of examples

# 7/26/2025

It's the weekend now, didn't get much done yesterday so I was eager to wrap up the 0.1.0 todos. I go to test things out by building things, and I'm met with:

```
error: Uncaught (in promise) "Not implemented support for Wasm modules: https://jsr.io/@b-fuze/deno-dom/0.1.52/build/deno-wasm/deno-wasm_bg.wasm"
```

...

![](https://media1.tenor.com/m/2U_hdX_TSCMAAAAd/patrick-bateman-stare.gif)

Welp, no more `deno-dom`. Did a bit of research and looks like `linkedom` is what I'm looking for! This should also resolve that issue I was having with casing of attributes, where `viewBox` was being output as `viewbox`. 

I realized it was more problematic than I initially thought because it was also affecting the `gradienttransform` attribute which is needed for rotating gradients.

Maybe I can use the esm shim import? But I don't know if that's better than just installing it ðŸ¤” lemme do a bit of research on that. **Update** is that it's pretty much the same thing as far as I can tell, I didn't dig too deep as `linkedom` is actually quite lightweight which is nice. I installed it just to keep consistent with having already installed things.

So no more `@b-fuze/deno-dom`! Unfortunate as WASM is pretty cool & should be faster - but `linkedom` looks to be also focused on performance so it shouldn't be a noticeable difference really, I'll switch back as the WASM side of things matures. 


Did a bit more looking into it and `linkedom` mentions deno in a recent update which is cool! That update also mentions workers being added, which I'm not sure if that refers to creating workers like in browsers or that the lib itself can now leverage workers. Either way the more I think about it the more my dismay about switching lessens.

Couple nice things with `linkedom`:
- Can now create in the SVG namespace like in browsers! No more asserting the output type!
- No more casing issues!

Ok I'm repeating myself at this point but what seemed like a major setback turned out to be an absolute win! Ok back to adding examples!

# 7/27/2025

Interesting start to the day!

After much fiddling with things, I finally got pretty much all the `0.1.0` todos wrapped up.
- Basic logo
- Basic Docs site
    - Up and running on github pages after a bunch of wrestling with some auto-generated things
- Exports and everything in place


Then I went to publish the npm package, now prior to this I *had* checked that the npm package with the name "NanoCharts" wasn't taken - it wasn't!

So I go to run `npm publish`, I login, all of that, and then at the last moment get hit with a message saying "NanoCharts" is too similar to existing package "nano-charts"!

I go check it out, lo' and behold - someone with quite a similar idea to me! Though this package had not been updated in about 7 years.

Alright then I'll go "minicharts" nope, also taken, same idea as well! Haha the odds! This time though it's 8 years ago. Ok surely "justcharts" will be available... Nope! Also taken, this time 8 months ago, though this one has no README or repo linked which is interesting.

I even partially committed to "justcharts" before realizing, I thought for sure that one would be available, ðŸ˜† you know what, I'm thinking I'll go with "toomanycharts". In the spirit of things, this one isn't taken either.

If I get a message saying someone has "too-manycharts" when I try to publish under that I'll explode.
