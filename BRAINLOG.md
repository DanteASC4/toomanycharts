Just realized I'm not really using min/max at all lol. I guess for now that's ok, I think incorporating those wouldn't be impossible but would be annoying to calc like a proportional automatic min or max based on given width/height.

Maybe not using it and just always having things be based on the height / width would be best to keep things as simple as possible for users.

Also just thought of labels being on the inside or outside. But that would mean viewbox padding if it were outside and not at the 'end' of each bar, since the start of each would be out of the viewBox. Though this wouldn't be too difficult to implement with a bit of exterior padding to the viewbox when labels are set to 'outside.' Unless that would throw off all the x/y caclulations...
